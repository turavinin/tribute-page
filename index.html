        <div class="article-timeline">
          <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li><strong>1923</strong>- Born in La Plata, Buenos Aires. In his early years he grew up in a humble house in the neighborhood of "El Mondongo". Just one street away was the Polyclinic Hospital. Maybe that was an omen of René's fate.</li>
            <li><strong>1936</strong> - He began his secondary studies at the "Colegio Nacional de La Plata", where he stood out as an excellent student, while helping to finance his studies as a discipline inspector.</li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - He began his university studies at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the University of La Plata. In the third year he began attending the Polyclinic Hospital, and with this his vocation was increased by having contact with patients for the first time.</li>
            <li><strong>1949</strong> - Favaloro graduated from university. As soon as he received, there was a vacancy for an auxiliary doctor, he acceded to the position on an interim basis, and a few months later they called him to confirm it. They asked him to fill out a card with his details, but in the last line he had to affirm that he accepted the government's doctrine. Putting the signature on that card meant betraying all its principles. He replied that he would think about it, but actually he knew clearly what the answer was going to be. Favaloro had been part of university movements that fought to keep the country on a democratic line, of freedom and justice, which is why he had even had to endure jail on occasion.</li>
            <li><strong>1950</strong> - Favaloro received a letter from an uncle from Jacinto Aráuz, a small town of 3,500 inhabitants in the desert area of La Pampa. He explained that the only doctor who attended the town, Dr. Dardo Rachou Vega, was ill. He arrived in Jacinto Aráuz in May 1950 and quickly made friends with Dr. Rachou. His illness turned out to be lung cancer. He passed away a few months later. By then Favaloro had already imbued himself with the joys and sufferings of that remote region, where the majority were dedicated to rural tasks. On November 18 of that same year he married his beloved María Antonia Delgado, with whom he began his romance since high school.</li>
            <li><strong>1952</strong> - His younger brother, Dr. Juan José Favaloro, joined the clinic. They transformed an old house into a 23-bed clinic, fully equipped. They created a welfare center and raised the social and educational level of the region.</li>
            <li><strong>1961</strong> - Twelve years after starting his work in the Province of La Pampa, René Favaloro was reborn with the concern to continue his studies as a surgeon. In one of his trips to La Plata, he expressed that wish to Professor Mainetti, who advised him that the right place was the Cleveland Clinic in the United States.</li>
            <li><strong>1962</strong> - He decided to travel to Ohio, United States and join the service of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. He worked first as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, in collaboration with Dr. Donald B. Effler, chief of cardiovascular surgery. It was there that René Favaloro's fundamental task began, myocardial revascularization surgery.</li>
            <li><strong>1967</strong> - Favaloro began to think about the possibility of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice for the first time in May of that year. The standardization of this technique called "bypass or myocardial revascularization surgery" was the fundamental work of his career, which made his prestige transcend the limits of that country, since the procedure would radically change the history of coronary heart disease. The first surgery was performed in May 1967, on a 51-year-old woman.</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - By June 1970, 1,086 coronary artery bypass grafts had already been performed in 951 patients, with a mortality of 4.2%. In this same year, George Green in New York began using direct anastomosis of the internal mammary artery. Dr. Favaloro, after contacting Green, decided to start using the left mammary artery and connected it with the anterior descending artery. After he left the Cleveland Clinic in 1971, Dr. Loop standardized this method and demonstrated excellent long-term results.</li>
            <li><strong>1971</strong> - Favaloro decided to return to Argentina.</li>
            <li><strong>1975</strong> - He created the Favaloro Foundation together with other collaborators and strengthened the work that he had been developing since his return to the country. One of his greatest prides was to have trained more than four hundred and fifty residents from all over Argentina and Latin America.</li>
            <li><strong>1980</strong>- He created the Basic Research Laboratory, which he financed with his own money for a long period.</li>
            <li><strong>2000</strong> - Argentina was experiencing a deep economic and political crisis, the Favaloro Foundation was also suffering the worst of its times in the financial context, since it owed about 75 million dollars as a result of the fact that the most important social works of the country did not make their payments and the large institutions did not provide subsidies. The renowned doctor was in great despair and disappointment, he could not tolerate that this hypocritical system had been installed in the country that did not support education, health, or science.</li>
            <li><strong>July 29, 2000</strong> - At 77 years of age, Favaloro made the tragic decision to kill himself by shooting himself to the heart. After his death it was learned that he had sent a letter to the then president of the nation, Dr. Fernando de la Rúa, which had never been read, in which he expressed his weariness of "being a beggar in his own country." </li>
